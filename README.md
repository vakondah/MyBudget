# MyBudget

This project is intended to simplify the estimations of the project budget. As it is known, there are a few methods used in Project Management
to predict the project's cost. For example, detailed bottom-up (and its variations such as PERT and Three-Point Average) estimation allows us
to make very accurate and efficient calculations; top-bottom methods such as parametric or analogous estimating models could be fast and can be
performed with minimal available data and resources.
The "My Budget" will allow the user to choose the type of estimation she wants to perform, enter all necessary data (or choose it from the provided templates),
calculate appropriate expenses, and output the result in the form of a table. During the data input, the user will not be allowed to enter invalid data, but she
will be able to change information from the templates or previously entered data. The result will be saved in the text file so the user can make a hard copy of it. 

This program is a couse project fot Computer Science I 160 class.
